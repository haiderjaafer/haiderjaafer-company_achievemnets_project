Yes, a file on the web or in a system transfer context has a Content-Type (also known as a MIME type or media type). 
Key Facts about Content-Type:
Purpose: It identifies the format of the data (e.g., text/html, image/png, application/pdf) so browsers or servers know how to process or display it.
HTTP Header: When files are transferred over HTTP, the Content-Type header is sent to describe the data.
File Uploads: When you upload a file via a browser, the browser usually determines the content-type based on the file extension.
Not Always Accurate: While a file has a content-type, 
it can sometimes be misconfigured on a server (e.g., serving a PDF as application/octet-stream or a wrong type). 
How to determine it:
From Browser/Server: It is read from the Content-Type HTTP header.
From File/Binary Data: Tools can "sniff" the content or read the magic numbers (file signature) to determine the type if it is unknown

examples 

from fastapi import Request

@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(request: Request):
    content_type = request.headers.get('Content-Type')
    # Further processing


import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
content_type = response.headers['Content-Type']
# or use .get() for safer access:
# content_type = response.headers.get('Content-Type')

print(f"The content type is: {content_type}")
